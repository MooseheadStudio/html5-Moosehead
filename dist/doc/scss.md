# The SCSS

All of these .scss files were not availiable by default. The SCSS has been painstaikingly hand coded to be in SCSS format to allow @moosehead.studio to rapid prototype.
We have released these SCSS files free to the public under the MIT licence (same as HTML5 Boilerplate.) 
_Appreciate it if you can link back to this Github page in your documentation._

This HTML5 template's SCSS includes:

* [_core.css](#_corescss)
* [_icons.css](#_iconsscss)
* [_mixins.css](#_mixinsscss)
* [_varibles.css](#_variblesscss)
* [main.css](#mainscss)
* [material-design-icons-scss.css](#material-design-icons-scss.css)
* [Normalize.css](#normalizescss)


## _core.scss, _icons.scss, _mixins.scss, _varibles.scss

These documents cover the default setup parameters for the material design icons.
Color, font weight, style, prefix, mixins, default code point locations, and varibles.

You can view these documents in the SCSS folder in the project.
