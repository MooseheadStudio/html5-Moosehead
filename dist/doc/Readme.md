[Getting started](TOC.md).

The Moosehead.studios' HTML5 boilerplate a professional front-end template for building easy, fast and adaptable websites.

When we started this project, our primary focus was on simple and past prototyping with a strong focus on ease of use. We tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases.

This project is the base on which all Moosehead Studios websites are built. We use `git` as a place for our template revisions and helping beginners get a good start on building their websites without to much trouble.
